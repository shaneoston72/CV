**I am living my dream.**

I had been growing increasingly disillusioned with my career as a Business Analyst and Project Manager. My commitment to the field lacked the motivation it once held for me. Following a health scare in October 2015, I reevaluated my life and concluded that drastic action was needed to reenergise my career and life. As I explored various options, my lifelong dreams to live in the United Kingdom and to be a software developer kept coming up. Despite advice from family and friends, **I sold everything I owned** - a car, a house and all but two suitcases of personal belongings -and gambled on a **new life** in the UK training as a software developer.

Five months later and after 16 weeks of Makers Academy, **life is an exciting adventure** again. I spend my days creating applications that expand my new knowledge of web development and software craftsmanship. I am part of a community of creative, really smart people that complement my creativity and stimulate my growth as a software developer. Today **I am a software developer**.

The next step in my rebirth as a software developer is to join an innovative team of brilliant developers to which I can apply my new knowledge of web development. I am eager to create elegant contributions to code that enhances the lives and experience of its users.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>
Before Makers I could create the simplest of web pages with HTML and CSS. Today I can create full stack applications using technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Javascript and AngularJS (see my contribution to [**Leave**](https://github.com/shaneoston72/smartAlarm-mobile)).  Before Makers Academy I could not tell you about RESTful APIs let alone create one. After Makers Academy I can create one and strap Angular and Ionic SPAs to it.

##### Knowledge Acquisition & Training
The number one skill that my cohort agrees that I possess is an ability to quickly sort through complex technologies to learn the key aspects and then convey this new knowledge to my teammates.

I have regularly led training sessions in which I taught complex technical subjects to non-technical users.

##### Facilitation and Public Speaking
Every role in my professional experience required leadership of joint-application design sessions with C-level executives and end-users.  This role required conflict resolution and facilitation of large, opinionated conversations.

##### Project Management and Leadership
I have experience managing multi-year projects, from strategic planning throughout development, deployment, support, and training.

##### <a name="projects">Projects</a>
Here's a sampling of some the work I participated in at Makers Academy. Projects are listed in chronological order to demonstrate the increasing complexity of the work we did.
