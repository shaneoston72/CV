###Profile
**Code saved my life.**

It was October 2015. I had lost the energy and motivation that I ordinarily brought to my work and my life. My once exciting career of business analysis and CRM implementation had become ordinary and unfulfilling. Life in general had become tedious. **It was bad. Really bad**.

I had the intuition that drastic action was required to reenergise my life. As I considered my options, my life-long dreams to live in the United Kingdom and to be a software developer recurred. Both represented radical change and, by any rational measure of prudence, were ill-advised. Despite this, **I sold everything I owned** - a car, a house and all but two suitcases of personal belongings -and gambled on a **new life** in the UK training as a software developer.

Five months later and after 16 weeks of Makers Academy, life is an exciting adventure. Every day I bound out of bed and hurtle myself into the world of coding. I spend my days creating applications that expand my new knowledge of web development and software craftsmanship. I am part of a community of creative, really smart people that complement by curiosity and stimulate my growth as a software developer. Today **I am a software developer**.

**I am living the dream**. The next logical step is to join an innovative team of brilliant developers to which I can apply my new knowledge of web development. I am eager to create elegant contributions to code that enhances the lives and experience of its users.

I invite you to read on as you consider my application. Let's discuss ways that a well-trained, eager junior developer can enhance your team.

### Skills
Before Makers I could create the simplest of web pages with HTML and CSS. Today I can create full stack applications using technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Javascript and AngularJS (see my contribution to [**Leave**](https://github.com/shaneoston72/smartAlarm-mobile)).  Before Makers Academy I could not tell you about RESTful APIs let alone create one. After Makers Academy I can create one and strap Angular and Ionic SPAs to it.

The number one skill that my cohort seems to agree that I possess is an ability to quickly sort through complex technologies to learn the key aspects of the tech and then convey this new knowledge to my teammates.

I have training and hands-on work in object-oriented design principles and programming, and pair programming gained from 16 weeks of intense, focused study and practice.

I bring a passion for elegantly designed, “clean” code and a creative, fun approach to coding to your team.

I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge of my chosen profession by standing on the shoulders of senior developers and participating in a supportive, innovative development team.

I have experience managing multi-year projects, from strategic planning throughout development, deployment, support, and training.

I am a relatable, cross-cultural leader with dual citizenship in the UK and US and numerous collaborations with colleagues from UK and North America.

Here's a sampling of some the work I participated in at Makers Academy. Projects are listed in chronological order to demonstrate the increasing complexity of the work we did.
